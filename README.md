# BetterAdmin
Plugin for SCP: Secret Laboratory that allows for blocking item and role spawns
Also includes a anti-camp feature, that will lock open doors if specific requirements are met, to prevent players from camping inside

If you have any issues with the plugin, please post them [here](https://github.com/HervusDerpus/BetterAdmin/issues)
If you need any support, feel free to come and ask on my [discord](https://github.com/HervusDerpus/BetterAdmin/issues)
